# Project 2

Make a collection of 3-5 brief texts and design and program a self-contained website to house them.

The website needs to include, at minimum: a) a landing page that links to all of the texts, and b) detail pages for each of the texts.

It should display and function well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

You may use HTML and CSS for this project. However, to encourage economy, the website must use a single linked stylesheet that is smaller than 1kb in size.

Consider:

* How are the texts thematically or conceptually linked? Do your thesis or degree project interests provide a useful starting point?
* How does the structure and navigation of your website relate to the organizing concept of your collection?
* How do your formal choices (typography, color, form) relate to the texts presented in your website?
* How can you make the experience for a reader straightforward and legible? How can you make it more challenging?
