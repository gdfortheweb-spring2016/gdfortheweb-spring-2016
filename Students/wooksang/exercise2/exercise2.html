<p>Fuck Content by Michael Rock</p>

<h1 class="no-indent">
A few years back I wrote a now widely distributed article entitled Designer as Author. In it I argued that designers aspire to be authors because we are insecure about the value of our work. We often feel if our work were more significant, we would garner more respect. We envy the power granted artists and authors. It is this deeply-seated anxiety that was behind a movement pushing designers toward the origination over the manipulation of content.</h1>
<h1 class="indent">Recently after giving a lecture on a similar topic I stopped by Starbucks to pick up a coffee on my way home. In America Starbucks has a program to print provocative quotes on their paper coffee cups. My cup that day happened to sum it up quite nicely. There, attributed to film critic Roger Ebert, my cup announced: “A movie is not what it is about, it’s how it is about it.”</h1>



<section>The Designer as Producer by Ellen Lupton</section>

<h2 class="no-indent">
The slogan “designer as author” has enlivened debates about the future of graphic design since the early 1990s. The word author suggests agency, intention, and creation, as opposed to the more passive functions of consulting, styling, and formatting. Authorship is a provocative model for rethinking the role of the graphic designer at the start of the millennium; it hinges, however, on a nostalgic ideal of the writer or artist as a singular point of origin. As an alternative to “designer as author” I suggest “designer as producer.”</h2>
<h2 class="indent">The power of the term “author”–its cultural authority–lies in its connection to the written text. In order for designers to take charge of the content and social function of their work, they need not become fluent writers, no more than an art director must become a professional photographer or illustrator in order to use these media effectively. In the business of film, a “producer” brings together a broad range of skills–writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and so on–in a work whose authorship is shared. For the designer to become a producer, she must have the skills to begin directing content, by critically navigating the social, aesthetic, and technological systems across which communications flow.</h2>
