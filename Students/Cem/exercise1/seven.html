<!-- <h1>it gives me the feeling</h1> 

	of something terrible
	and familiar
	a space
	between lives
	like seeing Marcel
	seeing Gilberte
	for the first time
	how the fact of life itself
	becomes a thing
	languished and melancholy
	I think I would like to lie
	among southern magnolias
	in snowfall
	dark skies above
	into which
	I will never enter
	I'm watching Maya Deren
	maybe I will smoke weed
	I called out sick
	it's the afternoon -->
