<h1>the rest of the poem</h1>

<p>I walk through the luminous humidity<br>
passing the <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=house">House</a> 
<em><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=of">of</a></em> 
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Seagram&biw=1284&bih=899&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGiui4oILLAhUIaxQKHYaTAMMQ_AUIBigB#" target="_blank">Seagram</a>
with its wet<br>
and its loungers and the construction to<br>
the left that closed the sidewalk if<br>
I ever get to be a construction worker<br>
I'd like to have a silver hat please<br>
and get to Moriarty's where I wait for<br>
LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and<br>
shaker the last five years my batting average<br>
is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in<br>
and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12<br>
times last night outside birdland by a cop<br>
a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible<br>
disease but we don't give her one we<br>
don't like terrible diseases, then<br>
we go eat some fish and some ale it's<br>
cool but crowded we don't like Lionel Trilling<br>
we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like<br>
Henry James so much we like Herman Melville<br>
we don't want to be in the poets' walk in<br>
San Francisco even we just want to be rich<br>
and walk on girders in our silver hats<br>
I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is<br>
thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi<br>
and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go<br>
back to work happy at the thought possibly so</p>
