<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> 

<p>You're constantly moving around and recording in different places. Do you feel like that transience is a key part of your work flow?

<p class="CM">Cass McCombs:</p> <p>Yeah. And it's just a joy to be able to work with a lot of different musicians. When you play with great musicians, whether they're schooled or self-taught, they keep you on your toes. It comes down to people's personalities and individual energies. I mean, this is rock'n'roll, not classical music. It's about people working together.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> 

What kind of personality are you looking for in a player?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Well, beggars can't be choosers. We don't have all the money in the world. So anyone who wants to be in the band and be broke-- that's their own death wish.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Well, I recently saw you guys in New York and it was sold out, which is pretty good.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Yeah, well, you should have seen the show in Birmingham. It's a long way from San Francisco to New York City. You can't sell out every show. But that doesn't bother me. As long as there are a few people there, I can lose myself, which is the ultimate goal. And that's happening more and more; the non-musical world is becoming less and less interesting to me.
"People just wanna see someone talking about themselves constantly. 
I'm not interested in that."</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> I watched the faux interview you recently put up on YouTube, which has a guy asking you a lot of ridiculous and funny questions. I feel that most people think of you as a serious singer/songwriter with a capital S, but are you trying to shade that view with that video and the title of this new album?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> I've always littered my songs with jokes. You might need to dig a little deeper to find the humor, but I would totally object to being some kind of distraught personality. I've never tried to attach myself to that.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Well, it seems safe to say that your last album, WIT'S END, was quite dark and didn't have many jokes. Would you agree?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> No.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> What's funny about that album to you?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Well, you can't just explain a joke, can you? Either it isn't funny, or the person just totally missed the punchline.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> I think the funniest song on Humor Risk is "Mystery Mail", and its tale of a couple of hapless drug dealers is myth-like in scope.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> The story in that song is somewhat of a modern myth. I wanted to write a really long and pulpy narrative about personalities that I grew up around in Northern California, so it's a little bit of this person, a little bit of another person, maybe a little bit of myself.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Nowadays, it seems like there's more of an onus on songwriters to write about themselves exclusively, and it's almost confusing to people when artists don't do that.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> People expect not just songwriters but all personalities to pontificate about their egos-- they just wanna see someone talking about themselves constantly. I'm not interested in that. It's not my way to talk about my feelings. They're impudent to myself, so it wouldn't make any sense if I tried to explain them to anyone else. I've never been to therapy-- not interested in it.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Do you think it's a conflict to get up onstage and perform for people even though you're not comfortable giving parts of yourself away?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> No. In fact, I think it fuels the performance. It doesn't help to bring in my own feelings. Making music and art is about expressing something that's universally human, maybe even beyond human, at best. To make it about the artist and to dwell upon biographical information can only make it singular, and I am really, really disgusted by that. Bringing the individual into it only distracts from the universal and makes it trivial. And then it's easy to wash your hands of it because you might not be from their background, or you might disagree with their personal perspective. So you discount it and go back into your corner instead of coming out and engaging with everything.
All these biopics and biographies and people gossiping about so-and-so's drug abuse or who's sleeping with who, it's just a bunch of nonsense. I've always been interested in an idea of boundless love-- an impersonal, big love.
"Dead men always have the last laugh. They win. They're dead. 
You can't hurt their feelings anymore."</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> But sometimes when I find out about an artist's bio and I have some similarities to them, it can strengthen my bond with their music.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> You think so?</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Yeah. Are there any artists that you liked more after reading about them a little bit?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Nothing comes to mind. Thank god we don't know a lot about Shakespeare or Moses or Homer or Lautr√©amont. These are the best guys we got, and their art is powerful because they're mysterious. Once biographical information contaminates your consciousness, it's impossible to erase it and look at someone's work the same way again.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> I'm curious whether the first song on Humor Risk, "Love Thine Enemy", is meant to be political at all.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> That song was written to express how you're not going to like everyone in this world. Everyone wants to be well-loved and appreciated but, at the same time, there are some people that just don't want to be your friend, and there's nothing you can do or say to change that. So it's about ushering them into the elevated status of enemy-- its kind of an honor to be someone's enemy. It sounds regal. If it's possible to have an enemy without making it personal or moral, then that's what I'm trying to do. I've been reading a lot of the Tao [Te Ching], and that's where this idea of the equilibrium of relationships came from. People take things a little too personal. I write these songs, and they're experiments with thoughts. That's it. I'm not a teacher.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> It actually seems like you're being taught on a lot of this album, too. "The Living Word", for instance, has references to several religious figures in it, and each one gets equal footing. It seems like you're open to a lot of different belief systems.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Well, I'm interested. And a lot of these religious texts make for good reading. That's why they hold up. Elvis Presley wore a Star of David and a cross around his neck and, when someone asked him about it, he said, "It makes me think." I love that quote. It's simple. It's beautiful. It's true. When I was young, I used to go to Baha'i camp, and they taught me a lot about the equality of religions.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Was that the main religious force in you life growing up?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> No.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> What was?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> No comment.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> The notion of death haunts WIT'S END, though you don't really sound scared of it.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Dead men always have the last laugh. They win. They're dead. You can't hurt their feelings anymore. I've been working on this song about a holy man who is about to die and who'll undoubtedly be entered into heaven. But Satan employs the grim reaper to play a trick on him by offering him a choice of one attribute from the physical world: time, personality, will. And if he chooses one, he ends up in purgatory. So with death comes a choice. And death is a choice.
"WIT'S END is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet."</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> I feel like there's a real timelessness about your music in the way it's played and the references you use.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> I don't know about timeless. I actually think most of what I do is completely modern, but universally modern. Who decides what timeless even means? Are the things that we consider timeless now going to, in fact, be considered timeless in 300 years? Probably not. But I do like the word timeless. That's a great word.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> Releasing this relatively upbeat album so close to WIT'S END makes it come off like something of a palette-cleanser.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> Maybe. They were both made kind of simultaneously, on different sides of the same room, so to speak. WIT'S END was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. WIT'S END is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> One of the things I really liked about WIT'S END was its unique instrumentation. A lot of the sounds are very particular and odd.</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> For one song, we filled a giant cedar box with metal objects from the kitchen, and the percussionist is banging a giant stone on top of the box and it's rattling the metal. That took about a half a day to do. We were probably just stoned.</p>

<p class="Pitchfork">Pitchfork:</p> I read an interview where you said that what you do is "craftwork" and not "Art." What did you mean by that?</p>

<p class="CM">CM:</p> In Oakland, there's a college now called the CCA [California College of the Arts]. It used to be called the CCAC [California College of Arts and Crafts], but somehow they thought that was too hippy-dippy, so they got rid of the C. I wish they didn't. Because, to me, craft work is the ultimate. Maybe I got this idea from the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, who was employed as a sculptor to the state and church, making coins and things. While he admired Michelangelo, he also made fun of his spiritual angst with art. I think a master craftsman is someone who is unpretentious. He has a physical object in front of him and, while he works with a higher aim, he doesn't let his personality get in the way of his art. It's simply about the task at hand and to make it as functional and necessary to the world as he can. So much of what people are making now is unnecessary. It's useless. I want to make something that's useful to someone, somewhere.</p>
