GREEN VALLEY, AZ—Compelled by physical discomfort to set down the remainder of his pulled pork sandwich and discontinue eating the small mound of French fries still sitting on his plate, local man <span class="area">Shane Plimpton</span> was said to be deeply disappointed in himself Wednesday for already being full. “Usually, I can handle a basket of mozzarella sticks and then a full entrée and still have room for a second beer, but this...this is just pathetic,” said a visibly downcast Plimpton, eventually turning his gaze away from the unfinished food items in disgust. “It’s hard to accept, but I’m actually stuffed. God, I’m better than this. I can’t be groaning and patting my full stomach when there’s still probably a dozen bites left. Where’s the dignity in that?” An utterly emasculated Plimpton was later seen placing his head in his hands and vowing to never let such a humiliation befall him again after a waitress stopped by to ask him if he needed a box for his leftovers.
