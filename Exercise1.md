# Exercise 1

Choose a poem. (See [poets.org](http://www.poets.org/) or [poetryfoundation.org](http://www.poetryfoundation.org)) Copy and paste the title, author, and full text into a new HTML document.

Try:
- Marking up the text using different tags
- Nesting tags
- Linking between pages
- Repeating or otherwise manipulating text

By the end of the class, aim to have a new interactive version of your poem that changes the experience for the reader of your poem. You’ll share your finished website with the class.
