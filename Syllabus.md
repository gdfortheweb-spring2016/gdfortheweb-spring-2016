# Overview

Design is a crucial element in making a website that is accessible, exciting, and effective. This class will look at ways of using fundamental graphic design principles and site design tools necessary to create sites that are strategic, interactive, energetic and visually imaginative. This course will also explore the social, political, and historical contexts around network technologies and look at the rich history of programmers, designers, artists, and others that have used the Web as a medium to develop new and alternative approaches to graphic design for the Web.

# Objectives

- Develop a methodology for conceptualizing, planning, designing, and developing for the Web
- Apply fundamental graphic design visual principles to design for the screen
- Understand how to structure information for interactive systems
- Develop familiarity with the technological infrastructure of the Web (domains, browsers, servers, etc.)
- Develop a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery
- Become familiar with version control as a means to collaborate and share your work
- Produce working prototypes of web pages using typical web development tools and frameworks
- Consider the Web as a public space, with its own communities, forms of engagement, modes of communication
- Become familiar with important graphic design precedents on the Web
- Develop novel approaches to graphic design for the Web

# Projects

The course will begin with a series of three quick experimental projects that will provide an opportunity to explore formal and interactive possibilities on the Web and to develop a working knowledge of the tools and techniques of design for the Web. Then, in the second half of the semester, you will draw on this earlier experimentation to develop an independent project that will be your primary output from this course.

# Schedule

|Week|Notes|
|:---|:---|
|1–2|Project 1|
|3–4|Project 2|
|5–6|Project 3|
|7–12|Final project|

# Grading

Grades from A to F will be assigned at both the middle and end of the semester. Only the semester grade is on record. The grade will be calculated as follows:

|Item|Percentage|
|:---|:---|
|Participation|30%|
|Project 1|10%|
|Project 2|10%|
|Project 3|10%|
|Final project|40%|
|TOTAL|100%|

Grades will be evaluated based on: strength of concepts and form, craft, level of risk-taking and depth of investigation, and relevance to a wider design and social context.

# Policies

Students should arrive on time and be prepared for every class. Three unexcused absences will result in failure of the course. Two late arrivals or early departures will be considered equivalent to one absence. Students are expected to participate in all critiques and to devote class time to work relevant to the course.
