# Project 1

Make a web presence for an art museum or gallery in New York.

This institution probably already has a complicated and comprehensive website. The goal isn't to make a faithful copy of it. Instead, the goal is to make a memorable and viable web presence that works within a limited palette and expresses a specific perspective on the institution.

You may use HTML for this project. (No CSS!)

Consider:

* What material from the existing website do you include? What material do you leave out?
* How do you structure this information? Does it appear across multiple pages or on a single page?
* How does hyperlinking between pages affect the experience for the visitor?
* How does sequence and markup add hierarchy and structure to the material on your website?
