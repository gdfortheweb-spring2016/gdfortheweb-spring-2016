# Project 1

For this project, you will select an art museum or gallery in New York and conceive and program a new web presence for it using just HTML. This institution probably already has a complicated and comprehensive website, and your goal isnâ€™t to make a faithful copy of it, but rather to make a memorable and successful web presence that works within the constraints of your limited palette and expresses a different perspective on the institution you chose.

Consider:
- What material from the existing website do you include? What material do you leave out?
- How do you structure this information? Does it appear across multiple pages or on a single page?
- How does hyperlinking between pages affect the experience for the visitor?
- How does sequence and markup add hierarchy and structure to the material on your website?
