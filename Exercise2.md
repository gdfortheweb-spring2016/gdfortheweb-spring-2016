# Exercise 2

Choose a text. (Try [ubu.com](http://ubu.com) or [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org) or feel free to choose your own text from another source.) Copy and paste the title, author, and full text into a new HTML document.

Try:
- Marking up the text using appropriate tags
- Adding styles to change the way the text looks
- Adding additional tags to further structure/style the text

By the end of the class, aim to have a new, 1-page version of your text that uses only HTML and the basic CSS properties that we’ve covered so far. You’ll share your finished text with the class.
