# Exercise 2

Choose a text with multiple authors (for example, the text of a conversation, interview, or dialogue). Copy and paste the title, authors, and full text into a new HTML document.

Try:

* Marking up the text using appropriate tags
* Using classes to designate writing by each author
* Writing styles to change the overall appearance of the text
* Writing styles to differentiate the different authors voices
* Adjusting typographic styles to refine typesetting
* Adding additional tags to further structure/style the text

By the end of the class, aim to have a new, 1-page version of your text that uses only HTML and the basic CSS properties that we’ve covered so far. You’ll share your finished website with the class.
