# Project 4

For your last project of the semester, you will select one of your three earlier studies — Project [1](Project1.md), [2](Project2.md), or [3](Project3.md) — to revisit and further develop into a finished project.

How you define the relationship between this final project and the study it’s based on is up to you — you may choose to focus on refining your earlier work, or you may use your earlier work as a starting point to inform the creation of a new project.

In either case, this project is a chance to take more time to work through the details that go into designing and programming a website that’s ready to be published on the Web:

* Drawing a favicon
* Writing styles for responsivity
* Registering a domain

We’ll follow this process:

## Idea, sketches and rough plan (Week 8)

Present the idea for your final project, sketches of sample screens, and a rough plan that shows the overall structure of your website. Lay your thoughts out in a landscape, letter-sized presentation and print for critique in class.

## Revised design and plan, working version (Week 9)

Present a revised complete set of screens for your project and a revised complete plan. Lay your thoughts out in a landscape, letter-sized presentation and print for critique in class. Present a working version of your website based on your revised plan. This version should be complete, with all content and pages, but may be missing some styles and interactive functionality. Post to GitHub.

## Revised version (Week 10)

Present a revised version of your website. This version should have all of the styles and interactive functionality that you’ve planned, but may need some further refinement or responsive styles. Post to GitHub. Bring some thoughts about possible domain names for your project.

## Revised version (Week 11)

Present a revised version of your website. This version should be as complete and refined as you’re able to make it. Post to GitHub. Register a domain and point it at your website.

## Final crit (Week 12)
