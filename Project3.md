# Project 3

Make a website to announce the visit of an artist or designer to RISD this semester.

The website should be 1-page.

It should present the information that would be included in a printed poster or flyer: title, date and location, and a brief description.

It should display and function well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

You may use HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery. (No other JS libraries!)

Consider:

* How can you create an interactive or visual experience thatâ€™s memorable and distinctive?
* How does the behavior of your website relate to the work of the artist or designer you chose for your announcement?
* How do your formal choices (typography, color, form) relate?
* How does your website function and appear differently on different devices?
